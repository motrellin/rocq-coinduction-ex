# Using Coinduction in Rocq

This repository contains a collection of examples demonstrating the use of coinduction in the Rocq proof assistant.
The examples are designed to illustrate various aspects of coinductive reasoning, including the definition of coinductive types, the use of coinductive proofs, and the application of coinduction in different contexts.

Each file in `theories/` (e.g. `CoNat.v`) shall provide a library for the associated positive and negative defined coinductive type.
